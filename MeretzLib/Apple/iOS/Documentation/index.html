	<h3>Quick Start</h3>
</p>

<p>
To get you familiar with the Meretz SDK for iOS as quickly as possible, we will walk through step-by-step the integration
of the Meretz SDK into the Apple Xcode iOS Game project template (which is what the MeretzSampleGame project is built upon).
To begin, open up the Meretz Xcode project as well as the MeretzSampleGame Xcode project
(found alongside the Meretz SDK for iOS repo).
</p>

<p>
The first thing we will do is to build the Meretz SDK (a static library) for our target platform of choice, and then use it in the
accompanying MeretzSampleGame Xcode project. For purposes of this demonstration, we will build for an iPhone 5 simulated device
(ie, build and run against the iOS Simulator as an iPhone 5) for both projects. This involves the following steps:
</p>

<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Open up the Meretz.xcodeproj project file.</li>
	<li>Set the target / active scheme to "iPhone 5" (simulator).<br clear="all" /><img src="images\xcode_target.png"></img></li>
	<li>Build the project - it should build cleanly with no errors or warnings.</li>
	<li>Note the build output:
		<p>
		<pre>
		Debug-iphonesimulator\
			libMeretz.a
			include\
				Meretz.h
		</pre>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Locate the static library file "libMeretz.a" in the MeretzSampleGame directory tree, and replace it with the one you just built.
	<br clear="all" /><img src="images\libMeretz.a.png"></img></li>
	<li>Close the Meretz.xcodeproj and open the MeretzSampleGame.xcodeproj file.</li>
	<li>Once again, set the target / active scheme to "iPhone 5" (simulator).</li>
	<li>Build and run the MeretzSampleGame project. It should build cleanly with no errors / warnings. Watch the Xcode console output
	for log output from the program. It should look something like this:<br clear="all" />
	<img src="images\06_SampleGame_Disconnected.png"></img></li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
Once you are successfully building and running the MeretzLib and MeretzSampleGame, you're ready to use the MeretzSampleGame
to exercise integration with your specific game. We will use the game
<a href="https://www.meretz.com/rewards/airwings">Air Wings</a> during this guide, but note that the process
is the same for any product integrating with Meretz, including your own.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#introduction"><big>&#9757; </big>Back to the top</a>

</p>

<p>
<a name="sample_game"></a>
<h3>MeretzSampleGame</h3>
</p>
<p>
The MeretzSampleGame illustrates the implementation of the core components of Meretz integration, which are:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Connecting a local device user to a Meretz account on the Meretz back-end, and retrieving a secret access-token which is needed
	for making any other calls to the Meretz back-end servers on their behalf.</li>
	<li>Retrieving a list of any newly-acquired items for your title which they have obtained from the Meretz website using their Meretz points.
	This operation is referred to as "consuming items"."</li>
	<li>Disconnecting a local device user from their Meretz account on the back-end (revoking their secret access-token).</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
As we go through these operations using the MeretzSampleGame, feel free to check out the game source code to see how the sample
game is interacting with the Meretz APIs and consider how these processes might work within the context of your title.
</p>

<p>
<a name="product_page_overview"></a>
<h4>Game Product Page Overview</h4>
</p>

<p>
<img src="images\01_AirWings.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
The first thing we will do is take note of a few things on our product page on the Meretz website (again, using Air Wings as our example title).
Your product page by default will have some descriptive data and images, along with a listing of one or more items which can be acquired for
your title using Meretz points. <b>Note that you will need to be signed in as a Meretz user for these Meretz site pages to be accessible to you</b>,
so go ahead and create (or request) a Meretz account now before proceeding further if needed.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\02_AirWings_Expanded.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
When you view the section showing additional product details, as shown here, observe there is a "Download" button.
As of this writing, there are some additional parameters you can add to the URL for a product page in order to enable the
browser UI for "Connect Code" generation, which is how a user will link their Meretz account with your product. This one-time-use
connection-code is exchanged for an access-key which your app saves and uses to access the Meretz back-end on their behalf. This way the
end-user is not required to enter their Meretz login / password in the app, but can still communicate with the Meretz back-end in a secure manner.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\03_AirWings_ForceShowConnect.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
To get the additional browser UI to show up, add the following parameters to the product page URL:
</p>
<p>
<pre>?force_show=1&amp;override_comingsoon=1</pre>
</p>
<p>
So for Air Wings, the URL will be: <a href="https://www.meretz.com/rewards/airwings?force_show=1&override_comingsoon=1">
https://www.meretz.com/rewards/airwings?force_show=1&amp;override_comingsoon=1</a>
</p>
<p>
Reload the product page using those additional URL parameters.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<a name="user_connect_code_generation"></a>
<h4>User Connect Code Generation</h4>
</p>

<p>
<img src="images\04_AirWings_ConnectButton.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
You should now see a new button, "Connect", which is the entry point to an end user connecting their Meretz account
to your app. Go ahead and click the "Connect" button now.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\05_AirWings_ConnectCode.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
You should now see a new "Connect Code" text field. This text field contains a unique, one-time-use code which can be used to generate
a secret access-key associated with the user for use in your app as a means of identification / authentication for that user. The
Connect Code is only good for about an hour, so if you wait too long to use it you may need to generate another one.
</p>
<p>
Go ahead and copy the Connect Code you just generated, and now launch the MeretzSampleGame which you built earlier.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\06_SampleGame_Disconnected.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
Upon initial launch of the MeretzSampleGame, it will be in a "disconnected" state, ie. no associated Meretz user account has been saved.
Let's change that by entering in the "Connect Code" generated earlier on the Meretz website into the UITextField at the top of the view
in the MeretzSampleGame. Doing so will initiate a call to the Meretz back-end to attempt an exchange of the input one-time-use
connection code for a secret access-key which the game can save for all future interaction with the Meretz back-end on behalf of the
user in your app.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\07_SampleGame_ConnectCodeEntered.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
After entering in your connection code into the UITextField, watch the Xcode console output for logged info as
the connection process progresses; it should complete quickly. Once it has completed, the MeretzSampleGame should reflect a
"connected" state, as shown below. Also note the console output showing the returned JSON from the HTTP calls to the Meretz back-end.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\08_SampleGame_Connected_NoNewItems.png"></img>
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<a href="#introduction"><big>&#9757; </big>Back to the top</a>
<hr />
</p>

<p>
<a name="item_consumption"></a>
<h4>Item Consumption</h4>
</p>

<p>
<img src="images\09_AirWings_ConnectedState.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
Let's now return to the product page for our app on the Meretz website. As a reminder, the URL is:
<a href="https://www.meretz.com/rewards/airwings?force_show=1&override_comingsoon=1">
https://www.meretz.com/rewards/airwings?force_show=1&amp;override_comingsoon=1</a> Notice that we are now shown as
being Connected with Meretz with regards to this app. Now that our Meretz account is connected with our app, our app will
be able to detect when a user has acquired items for our app by exchanging Meretz points for them. We will walk through this
process next.
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
<img src="images\10_AirWings_TwoPurchases.png" width=296 height=493 align="left"></img>
Assuming you have some Meretz points in your account, go ahead and purchase a couple items for your app. Once your purchases
have completed successfully, return to the MeretzSampleGame app.
</p>
<p>
If you need some Meretz points, either amp up your workout routine or contact Meretz developer support to get some!
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
Back in the MeretzSampleGame app, any time you are in the "connected" state, you can initiate an "item consume" operation by
clicking the "Consume Items" button. Go ahead and click that button now, and watch the Xcode console output.
As you will see from the console log output, the items which you recently acquired on the Meretz website are now returned
to the MeretzSampleGame. This would be the point where your app can take the appropriate action on behalf of the user to
account for their recent acquisition of your app's items using Meretz points. Your app's products are uniquely identified by
the PublicId field, and other important product-related information is available as well. Refer to the <b>MeretzItem</b>
object described below.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images\11_SampleGame_TwoItemsConsumed.png"></img>
</p><br clear="all" />

<p>
With that, we have explored the aspects of integrating Meretz into an iOS app using the Meretz SDK for iOS. Again, you are
encouraged to dig into the MeretzSampleGame source code to see how things are working under the hood. You can also dive into
the Meretz SDK source code as well, if desired, to look under the hood at how the SDK works.

<a name="api_reference"></a>
<h3>Meretz SDK API Reference</h3>
</p>

<p>
The following sections of this guide give a high-level overview of the Meretz SDK for iOS, covering the
data structures and interfaces that your iOS application will need to use and interact with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="initialization"></a>
<h3>Meretz Initialization</h3>
</p>

<p>
The following APIs are available to perform various aspects of Meretz API initialization. In most cases you will only need to
call the <b>init</b> method, but there are other useful APIs as well, described below:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
	<li><pre>- (instancetype) init: (NSString *) savedAccessToken optionalDelegate: (id<MeretzDelegate>) aDelegate;</pre>
	Called to initialize Meretz. Inputs are an optional saved user access token, and an optional delegate object. In most cases,
	this is the only Meretz-related setup call that will be required.</li>
	<li><pre>- (void)setMeretzDelegate:(id<MeretzDelegate>) newDelegate;</pre>
	Called to set (or clear) the Meretz delegate object directly, if needed.</li>
	<li>APIs to use a non-default Meretz REST server instance:
		<ul>
		<li><pre>- (void) setMeretzHostName: (NSString *) hostName;</pre>
		Set the Meretz server host name. The default is: <b>www.meretz.com</b></li>
		<li><pre>- (void) setMeretzPort: (unsigned short) port;</pre>
		Set the Meretz server port. The default is: <b>443</b></li>
		<li><pre>- (void) setMeretzProtocol: (NSString *) protocol;</pre>
		Set the Meretz REST protocol. The default is: <b>HTTPS</b></li>
		<li><pre>- (void) setMeretzAPIPath: (NSString *) apiPath;</pre>
		Set the Meretz REST API path. The default is: <b>/api</b></li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><pre>- (NSString *) getMeretzServerString;</pre>
	Returns a string representation of the Meretz REST server settings.</li>
	<li><pre>- (NSString *) getMeretzUserAccessToken;</pre>
	Called to return the active Meretz user access-token.</li>
	<li><pre>- (void) setMeretzUserAccessToken: (NSString *) accessToken;</pre>
	Called to set the Meretz user access-token for the session. Usually you need only call this upon receipt of a new
	user access token after a successful user connect, or to clear it after a user disconnect operation.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
<a href="#introduction"><big>&#9757; </big>Back to the top</a>
<hr />
</p>

<p>
<a name="delegate_protocol"></a>
<h3>Meretz Delegate Protocol</h3>
</p>

<p>
Implementing the MeretzDelegate protocol is the simplest and most straightforward means of integrating the Meretz SDK into
your iOS application. When implemented, the MeretzDelegate protocol will allow your app to be notified upon completion of
any of the asynchronous operations available without the need to manage these operations in any way.
</p>

<p>
To implement the MeretzDelegate protocol, your app will need to implement the following methods:
	<ul>
	<li><pre>- (void) didVendorUserConnectFinish:(MeretzVendorUserConnectResult *)result;</pre>
	Called when a user connection with the Meretz back-end completes (via <b>startVendorUserConnect</b>).
	If successful, the returned access token should be saved for future use.</li>
	<li><pre>- (void) didVendorUserDisconnectFinish:(MeretzResult *)result;</pre>
	Called when a user disconnection from the Meretz back-end completes (via <b>startVendorUserDisconnect</b>).
	If successful, the user is no longer connected with the Meretz back end for your app and any saved
	access token is now invalid and should be discarded.</li>
	<li><pre>- (void) didVendorConsumeAcknowledgeFinish:(MeretzVendorConsumeResult *)result;</pre>
	Called when an item consume task for any newly acquired items completes (via <b>startVendorConsumeNewItems</b>,
	or the low-level API <b>vendorConsumeAcknowledge</b>).
	If successul, the returned array of MeretzItem objects contain entries describing any items for your app
	acquired with Meretz points since the last time you consumed items.</li>
	<li><pre>- (void) didVendorConsumeWithinRangeFinish:(MeretzVendorConsumeResult *)result;</pre>
	This is called only when the low-level task <b>vendorConsumeWithinRange</b> completes. If you do
	not use that API, your delegate method for this selector can be empty; otherwise, upon completion it
	will be passed an array of MeretzItem objects newly acquired with Meretz points within the date range
	specified when <b>vendorConsumeWithinRange</b> was called.</li>
	<li><pre>- (void) didVendorConsumeGetNewFinish:(MeretzVendorConsumeResult *)result;</pre>
	This is called only when the low-level task <b>vendorConsumeGetNew</b> completes. If you do not use
	that API, your delegate method for this selector can be empty; otherwise, upon completion it
	will be passed an array of MeretzItem objects newly acquired with Meretz points, but not yet flagged as
	having been "consumed" by your app. The flagging as "consumed" happens via a call to the low-level API
	<b>vendorConsumeAcknowledge</b>.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
<a name="data_structures"></a>
<h3>Meretz Data Structures</h3>
</p>

<p>
The following data structures are used when interfacing with the Meretz backend via the Meretz SDK for iOS:
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Meretz object:</b> an instance of an interface between a user and the Meretz back-end. Note that any such
	interface is setup on a per-user basis per program run.
	<pre>
	@interface Meretz : NSObject { ... }
	</pre></li>
	<li><b>Meretz ItemDefinition object:</b> a container for meta-data on an app's item
	<pre>
	@interface MeretzItemDefinition : NSObject
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *PublicId;
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *Name;
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *Description;
	@end
	</pre></li>
	<li><b>Meretz Item object:</b> a container for instance data on an item acquired by the end user for your app
	from a transaction with the Meretz back-end
	<pre>
	@interface MeretzItem : NSObject
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *PublicId;
		@property (nonatomic, retain) MeretzItemDefinition *ItemDefinition;
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *Price;
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *Code;
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSDate *ConsumedTime;
	@end
	</pre></li>
	<li><b>Meretz API call result:</b> parent class for all asynchronous API operation results
	<pre>
	@interface MeretzResult : NSObject
		// will be a BOOL, indicates successful execution of the requested operation
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber* Success;
		// MeretzAPIResult code
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString* ErrorCode;
		// human-readable error details
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString* ErrorMessage;
	@end
	</pre></li>
	<li><b>Meretz Vendor User Connect Result:</b> result from an asynchronous vendor-to-Meretz-user connection operation.
	If successful, the AccessToken parameter should be saved off for use in future Meretz API calls.
	<pre>
	@interface MeretzVendorUserConnectResult : MeretzResult
		// access-token GUID as a string
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString* AccessToken;
	@end
	</pre></li>
	<li><b>Meretz Vendor Item Consume Result:</b> result from any of the asynchronous vendor-item-consume operations.
	Will contain an array of MeretzItem objects.
	<pre>
	@interface MeretzVendorConsumeResult : MeretzResult
		// array of MeretzItem objects consumed
		@property (nonatomic, retain) NSArray* Items;
	@end
	</pre></li>
	</ul>
